- The video addresses the **Year 2038 problem**, also known as the **Y2K38 Super Bug** or **Unixcalypse**.
- Similar to the Y2K Bug, this problem relates to how computers count and store date and time.
- **Systems affected:** Airlines, trains, stock trading, payments, and the power grid.

- The root cause is tied to the use of 32-bit systems for timekeeping, leading to an overflow issue on ==January 19, 2038==.



## Solutions and Recommendations

- Early awareness and action are emphasized to prevent potential chaos.
- The solution is to upgrade the system to use the 64-bit signed integer format, which allows for much larger values and postpones the problem for about 292 billion years.
- However, ==many embedded systems and devices that use 32-bit== microcontrollers may be difficult or impossible to upgrade because of hardware limitations, so ==replacement is required== to avoid the bug.
