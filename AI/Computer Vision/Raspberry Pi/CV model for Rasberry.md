### 1. Improved Swin Transformer with Attention-Based Convolution (ABC) and SwinFace

These are newer, more advanced models that utilize Transformer architectures, known for handling complex patterns and relationships in data:

- **Improved Swin Transformer with ABC**: This model integrates attention mechanisms with convolution, which enhances its ability to focus on relevant features within an image, making it particularly effective for detailed and context-aware tasks like age estimation​ ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1136934/full))​.
- **SwinFace**: A multi-task model designed to handle various face-related tasks including face recognition, expression recognition, age estimation, and attribute estimation. It leverages a Transformer-based architecture to improve performance across these tasks by benefiting from a shared learning process​ ([ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2308.11509v1.pdf))​.

### 2. Deep EXpectation (DEX), VGGFace, AgeNet and GenderNet, Inception

These models are generally older and use more traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures:

- **Deep EXpectation (DEX)**: Specifically focuses on age prediction by treating it as a classification problem across multiple age classes. It is known for its high performance on age estimation tasks, utilizing a deep CNN trained on large labeled datasets .
- **VGGFace**: Primarily developed for face recognition tasks but can be adapted for age and gender classification. It is based on the VGG architecture, which is a deep CNN known for its effectiveness in image recognition due to its simplicity and depth​ ([Home](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/))​.
- **AgeNet and GenderNet**: These are specialized models for age and gender classification. They use CNNs and are typically pre-trained on demographic datasets before being fine-tuned for specific age and gender classification tasks .
- **Inception**: A versatile model originally designed for broad image classification tasks. It can be retrained to perform age and gender detection, benefiting from its ability to learn complex and abstract patterns through a sophisticated layering architecture .
