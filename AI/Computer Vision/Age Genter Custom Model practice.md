CNN CV models strong with facial Classification 


1. **Deep EXpectation (DEX)**: A model specifically trained on the IMDB-WIKI dataset to predict the age of a person from a single image. It uses a deep CNN architecture and is trained with a loss function that treats age prediction as a classification problem.
    
2. **VGGFace**: Originally designed for face recognition, VGGFace models can be fine-tuned for age and gender classification tasks. They use deep CNN structures based on the VGG architecture.
    
3. **AgeNet and GenderNet**: These are models specifically trained for age and gender classification using deep learning. They typically use CNNs trained on large datasets containing labeled images with age and gender information.
    
4. **Inception**: While primarily used for image classification, Google’s Inception model can be adapted for age and gender detection by retraining the final layers on age and gender-labeled datasets.
    

These models excel in extracting features from facial data, making them suitable for tasks like age and gender classification.

These models vary in their approach—some are pre-trained on general tasks and require fine-tuning for specific tasks like age and gender classification, while others are directly trained for these tasks. The information on these models comes from various studies and papers on facial recognition and demographic classification using deep learning techniques. For detailed technical specifications and training details, reviewing specific research papers or official documentation would be beneficial.
