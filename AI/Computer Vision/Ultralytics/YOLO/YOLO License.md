Since April 2023, YOLO has implemented a new license policy: 
- **Open Source Requirement**: Without a business license, any project using YOLO must be open-source if the model is functional. 
- **Business License**: Companies need to purchase a business license from Ultralytics. Pricing details are not publicly available and require direct inquiry. ## Considerations and Alternatives


### Inquiry Points: 
- **Current Practices**: Investigate how companies like Ubicom are handling the licensing issue. 
- **License Necessity**: Evaluate if the business license is essential or if other models should be considered. 

### Alternative Object Detectors for Commercial Use: 
1. **YOLOv4**: Widely used, effective for various applications. 
2. **YOLOX**: Apache 2.0 licensed, making it a safe choice for commercial projects. - [YOLOX GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX) 
3. **YOLONAS**: Apache 2.0 licensed, free to use but requires training from scratch. 
4. **YOLOv7/YOLONAS**: Despite the GNU GPL 3.0 license, using the model weights might be permissible as they are considered outputs of the program rather than derivative works. 
### Other Frameworks: 
- **MMDetection**: Some users prefer this framework for object detection tasks. 
### Discussion and Recommendations:
- **Reddit Discussion**: A useful thread on preferred object detectors for commercial applications.

- [!NOTE] Using models like YOLOv7/YOLOv9 under GNU GPL 3.0 might be acceptable if the model weights are considered program outputs, not derivative works.
