Gemini Advanced is the first advanced AI model that can compete with GPT-4.

Similarities:
* ChatGPT and Gemini both use data from machine learning models to answer questions and create images, text and videos. 
* OpenAI and Google are continuously improving the large language models (LLMs) behind ChatGPT and Gemini to give them a greater ability to generate human-like text.
* Both generate hallucinations and even warn users of that in their responses.
### Data Sources

- ChatGPT, depending on the version (GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4), utilizes ==predefined data sets== with cutoffs at April 2023 for GPT-4. But it can search recent data through Bing
- Gemini draws from data available ==on the internet in real-time==, aiming for relevancy and specificity in areas like coding or current scientific research

### User Experience

- ChatGPT also ==includes an API== that developers can use to integrate OpenAI LLMs into third-party software. 
	It lacks a Save button, but users can copy and paste answers from ChatGPT into another application. 
	It does have an Archive button that can list previous responses in ChatGPT's left-hand pane for quick retrieval.
	Because of OpenAI's close partnership with Microsoft, ChatGPT can be used through Windows apps such as ==Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook==. Also, Microsoft's Copilot AI assistants use ChatGPT-4's language model.
	
- Gemini Pro's interface gives users a chance to ==export it to Google Docs or Gmail==.  Gemini's ability to ==create images is on hold== until Google improves that feature.
	Google Ultra 1.0 has ==no API yet==. 
	Google does plan to integrate Gemini with its applications such as Docs, Gmail, Youtube, Google Meet and Google Slides as part of its Google One AI Premium subscription. 

### Data Storage and Privacy

- Both platforms store user data, but their policies differ. 
	ChatGPT ==archives all interactions==, which may raise privacy concerns if sensitive or personal information is shared. The chatbot might use these responses in its LLM for training. 
	
	Gemini stores conversations in a user's Google account, ==with customizable retention periods==(3-36 months), but also raises privacy considerations due to Gemini conversations can also appear in searches.
	They both use user data to develop their service.
	

### Capabilities and Use Cases

- Generally, ChatGPT has been noted for its strength in ==text-based tasks== and conversation, making it ideal for applications that require natural language processing and generation. 
- Gemini's advantages lie in handling ==multimedia content== and integrating with Google's ecosystem, potentially offering a broader range of applicationsâ€‹


### GPT4's Strength
- Uses code in a more sophisticated way 
- Better at hard verbal tasks  
- More conversational
- 
### Gemini's Strength
- Better at processing on long, complex reasoning chains
- Better at  translating into non-English languages
- Better at explanations and search. 
- Better at Processing information and automates tasks efficiently. 

### Gemini's Weakness
- Mathematical reasoning -- especially with large numbers 
- Shows bias on multiple choice questions
- Aggressive content filtering blocked many responses.
